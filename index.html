            You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't
            worry kiddo, where there's a demand there will be a supply, we'll
            all have our roads.

            if i came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded
            that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in
            return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for,
            would you consider that theft?

            Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect
            their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons. <br />

            A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the
            highest respect.
